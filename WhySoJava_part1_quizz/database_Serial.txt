?2. What is java deserialization ?
XXConversion of byte stream  into a state of an object
Conversion of the state of an object into a byte stream.
I do not know
None of the above


3. How to spot java serialized object ?
XX.ser file extention, starting bytes aced0005, base64 encoded starting bytes RO0AB
trust your instincts
ask fortune-teller
None of the above

?4. Potential impact of insecure deserialization ?
XXRCE, if gadget/gadget chain was found/bruteforced, logic errors via modyfing serialized objects, if there is no server side validation
Cryptographic failures
Server target explosion
None of the above

?5. How to mitigate insecure deserialization ?
XXif its not necessary: avoid i, know your frameworks and configure them accordingly to the recommendations, it its necessary whitelist what objects can be deserialized
call a fortune teller for help
Pray and make blood sacrifice to the Java gods
None of the above


?6. What is an deserialization gadget ?
XXpiece of code which can be used to achieve rce via java deserialization
popular inspector, toon's character
I do not know
None of the above

?7. Must EvilGadget class be available in the classpath of the Java program to achieve RCE ? 
XXTrue
False
I do not know
None of the above

?8. Must EvilGadget class be used by the Java main program to achieve RCE ?
True
XXFalse
I do not know
None of the above

?9. What is the name of the tool to inspects Java libraries and classpaths for gadget chains?
XXinspectorGadget
ysoserial
RMITaste
rmiscout

?10. If gadget inspector finds a gadget chain, Can an exploit ALWAYS be built from it?
True
XXFalse, not always ! The analysis uses some simplifying assumptions and can report false positives (gadget chains that don't actually exist)
I do not know
None of the above

11. If no gadget chains were found by gadgetinspector, does that mean my application is safe from exploitation? 
True
XXFalse, the gadget inspector has a very narrow set of "sink" functions which it considers to have "interesting" side effects. This certainly doesn't mean there aren't other interesting or dangerous behaviors not in the list.
I do not know
None of the above

12. What is the name of tool that generates payloads that exploit unsafe Java object deserialization?
XXysoserial
inspectorGadget
gadgetProbe
Inteliji

13. What is the name of payload which triggers a DNS lookup during deserialization ?
XXURLDNS
